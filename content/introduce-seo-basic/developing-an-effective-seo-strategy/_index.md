- **Analyze Competitor Keywords**: Study the keywords your competitors are ranking for to identify potential gaps and opportunities in your strategy.
- **Group Keywords by Intent**: Classify keywords into categories based on user intent, such as informational, navigational, or transactional. This will help you create content that aligns with user expectations.
